# The Weather Dashboard is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to search for current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast for any city. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updates the UI to present the information in an easily digestible format.
